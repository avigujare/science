    <h1>Here are some fun facts!</h1>

    <h2>Fact 1: The World Has Been Using Wind Energy Since 500 BC
    Wind turbines weren’t invented until the 1800s, after the discovery of electricity. Windmills, on the other hand, have been around for centuries and used to pump water, cut wood and grind grain. Now, large wind turbines can provide electricity to power all those needs and more. </h2>
    <h2>Fact 2: Wind Turbines Are Taller Than the Statue of Liberty
    To produce the amount of electricity that wind turbines can, a large onshore model is typically around 330 feet high, with their rotors spanning about 500 feet. Offshore models are even taller: 500 feet high with rotors spanning over 800 feet. </h2>
    <h2>Fact 3: The United States Has Over 141,000 Megawatts (MW) of Wind Capacity
    To put it in perspective, one MW, which is 1,000 kilowatts (kWh), can power about 750 homes. Wind energy is also the largest renewable energy source in the United States. Everything's bigger in Texas, with it being the leading state in wind energy production.</h2>
    <h2>Fact 4: Wind Energy Is Another Form of Solar Energy 
    A gust of wind is never random. Wind is a result of the uneven heating of the earth’s surface. Because of the different types of surfaces (land and water), the earth absorbs the sun’s heat at different rates, which results in wind currents. That’s why the source of wind energy is the sun. </h2>
    <h2>Fact 5: A Typical Wind Turbine Can Power Around 1,300 Homes
    Every month, an onshore turbine can produce 843,000 kWh of electricity. That’s enough to power several neighborhoods. A singular onshore or offshore wind turbine can produce enough energy in about three hours to power a single home for a month. </h2>
    <h2>Fact 6: 40 States Have Wind Farms   
    The U.S. is the third largest wind energy producer in the world. With wind farms in 40 out of 50 states, wind power is resourceful and profitable. The top five states are Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas and Illinois. 

</h2>
    <h2>Fact 7: A Small Wind Turbine Could Power a Business
    Every day people can benefit from harnessing wind power. Several factors determine whether you’re eligible. These include wind strength on your property, having at least an acre of land, being allowed to build wind turbines in your area, and having no access to a power grid. </h2>
    <h2>Fact 8: Wind Turbines Can Last for 20-30 Years
    This is just the estimated life of a wind turbine excluding the servicing it will need throughout the years. Items such as blades, gearboxes, and generators will most likely need to be replaced. When it does come time to replace the entire wind turbine, two things could happen: the turbine goes through the process of being replaced or it gets removed and the land gets restored to how it was before. </h2>
    <h2>Fact 9: Wind Power Has Become More Affordable
    Since the boom of wind turbines in the 1980s, there has been a significant decline in the cost of wind turbines. It has become cheaper and more efficient as technology continues to improve. It is estimated that since the ‘80s, the cost of producing energy from the wind has dropped about 90%. </h2>
    <h2>Fact 10:  Wind Turbine Service Technician Is One of the Fastest-Growing Jobs in the United States
    The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that between 2022 and 2032, the job outlook for wind technicians is projected to grow 45%.63 That makes this job one of the fastest-growing occupations in the country. This is more than just a fun fact about wind energy. It’s a great opportunity to train and become involved with it!</h2>

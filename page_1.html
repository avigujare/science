    <h1>How is the Wind Energy produced?</h1>
</header>

<div class="content">
    <p>Wind energy is made by using the wind to create electricity. This happens with giant machines called wind turbines. They’re super tall, with huge blades that spin when the wind blows.

      When the wind pushes the blades, they start to spin, and this makes a part called the rotor spin too. The rotor is connected to a generator, and the generator’s job is to turn that spinning into electricity. It’s kind of like how riding a bike makes the wheels spin, but instead of moving a bike, the turbine is making power.

      Once the electricity is made, it goes through wires to a transformer, which gets it ready to travel through power lines. Then it can be used in houses, schools, and pretty much anywhere that needs power.

      Wind energy is cool because it’s clean and doesn’t pollute the air. It’s also renewable, which means we’ll never run out of wind. Wind farms, which are groups of wind turbines, are usually built in windy places like open fields, on hilltops, or even in the ocean. Wind power helps keep the planet healthy and is a smart way to make energy!

    <h1>How and why Wind Energy wasted?</h1>
</header>

<div class="content">
    <p>Wind energy can get wasted for a few reasons, even though it’s a really good way to make electricity.

      One reason is that sometimes wind turbines make more electricity than people actually need. This can happen at night when people aren’t using as much power. If there’s no way to save the extra electricity, like in big batteries, it just goes to waste because it can’t be saved for later.

      Another reason is that wind turbines only make electricity when the wind is blowing. If it’s a really windy day but there aren’t enough people using power or enough batteries to store it, some of the energy can’t be used.

      Lastly, wind farms are usually built in windy places that are far away from cities, like in the ocean or on big hills. Sometimes the power lines, called the grid, aren’t strong enough or big enough to carry all that electricity to the places that need it. So, some of the energy gets wasted.

      Even though wind energy is clean and renewable, these problems can stop us from using all the power it makes. Scientists and engineers are working on ways to fix this so less wind energy is wasted in the future!
